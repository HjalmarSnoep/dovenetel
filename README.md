## we start by cutting all cardboard gathered in the last year
into ribbons, gather it in a big box, so we can search the shed for latex gloves. biiiiig job that I can do watching tv.
and cleaning up, so I get my freedom back...

## desigN rough first

I proposed inscribed circle method:

https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Regular-polygon-inscribed-in-the-circle_fig4_339760580

formula=2*PI/sin(PI/n) (n= nr of vertices of regular polygon.. inscribed circle circumference
I made a calculator... see code. inscribed_circles.html

You can easily do sizes for 12 johnson soldids, here
calculatoratoz.com/en/johnson-solids-Calculators/CalcList-2681

radius of circles inscribed to create
we need three holy numbers...
equilateral triangle circumference of inscribed circle
square rib to circumference
pentagon to circumference

basic inscribed circles  circumference
- 3- 1.813799364234217 lwngth 3 holes every 0.6045997880780724
- 4- 3.1415926535897922 4 holes every 0.7853981633974481
- 5- 4.324031329886044 5 holes every 0.8648062659772089
- 6- 5.441398092702656 6 holes every 0.9068996821171093

## we start with a sleeping-pod
Instructions on wav.

I can only start tomorrow. Maybe we need to go to the gamma, but check the shed. you have it all.
also screws but we need to search the shed for supplies.. I know you want to... but 
film your efforts you need to prove you are capable, or they will prevent you doing this. it´s too weird.
Family and friends will overstep their jurisdiction..
Once you publish it on youtube, people will think that is why you do it.. (dwazenheuvel) and apparantly then
it is fine...
That´s not your goal, it´s a socially acceptable cover. 
Goal is to make a practical environment where you feel at home. Listen yo your gut..
SHowing you Indra´s net on a daily basis.
Also It´s pracical and easy to heat or cool??? But well isolated and light in the least...
Keep air holes and think of light( 48vbattery powered usb light with switch is best I think..
(heat can´t get away, right?? so even  LED heat must be reconned with) So don´t build it in yet!!!


# biomorphic 3d zentangling (dovenetel)
transforming my house/

## step 1
 measuring (fotographing)
 
 ## step 2
 Hollow out with booleans in Blender-> render (you can skip this step, but it gives more control)
 
 ## step 3
Deep dream renders or photographs with "prompt" "white biomorphic interior" and "colored lights" (modern art nouveau organic style which pleases me..) 
30-60% stable diffusion.
 
 ## step 4 
Just get inspired by this semi-accurate photographs and go wild.... Sketch on walls?
- Fit pipes to drawng curves.
- idea: Use Johnson Solids (for instanct pentagonal cuppola J5 for dome) (inscribed circle method), which means mearuring and bending pipes and drilling holes, basically.. This makes it easies to implement symmetry.

## step 5
PLan electrical wires by just connecting all that needs to be connected. test.. because is will be inaccessable after.

## step 6- inside
Use toilet paper, cardboard (paperclay) and 3D pen to do finishing.

## step 6-outside 
we use papercrete and coloring and waterglass outside.. ALso we dig holes.
