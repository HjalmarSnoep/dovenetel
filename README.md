transforming my house/

## step 1
 measuring (fotographing)
 
 ## step 2
 Hollow out with booleans in Blender-> render (you can skip this step, but it gives more control)
 
 ## step 3
Deep dream renders or photographs with "prompt" "white biomorphic interior" and "colored lights" (modern art nouveau organic style which pleases me..) 
30-60% stable diffusion.
 
 ## step 4 
Just get inspired by this semi-accurate photographs and go wild.... Sketch on walls?
- Fit pipes to drawng curves.
- idea: Use Johnson Solids (for instanct pentagonal cuppola J5 for dome) (inscribed circle method), which means mearuring and bending pipes and drilling holes, basically.. This makes it easies to implement symmetry.

## step 5
PLan electrical wires by just connecting all that needs to be connected. test.. because is will be inaccessable after.

## step 6- inside
Use toilet paper, cardboard (paperclay) and 3D pen to do finishing.

## step 6-outside 
we use papercrete and coloring and waterglass outside.. ALso we dig holes.
